Freedom cash lenders hours

Stated loan durations—the number of months a loan is scheduled to last at the time the borrower signs the contract—generally vary from four to 60 months. The average stated loan duration for the analyzed sample is about one month for every $70 borrowed for small loans and $120 for large loans. However, the stated durations tend to differ substantially from the number of months that borrowers spend in debt because most loans are refinanced. (See the “Upfront fees, front-loaded interest charges harm consumers who refinance or repay early” section below.) For instance, it would take twice as long for a borrower to repay a $1,000 loan with a 12-month stated term if a loan is refinanced three times after its fourth month.
